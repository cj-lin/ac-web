        "A bullied, skinny kid too afraid to stand up for himself, Greg used to live in fear. At age 12, he decided to change and spent his newspaper route money on a gym membership and undertook rigorous weight training and the study of martial arts. He then decided to take on two massive challenges, to become the Australian National Bodybuilding Champion and a Karate Master. It was here Greg learned to unravel the warriors code and by applying its principles he revealed how limitless his life could become.",
        "In 2019, Greg became an Accredited Speaker by Toastmasters International, making him 1 of 88 speakers globally in over 40 years to receive this honor. Greg’s ability to transfer his mindset into totally new areas of life and master them in relatively short time has had him labelled by many as the MASTER OF REMASTERY. Let Greg show you the steps to master your mindset and remaster your life."
